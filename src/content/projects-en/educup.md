At EducUp, I began my journey as a developer, being part of a small team with big aspirations. As the company grew, so did my responsibilities and challenges, leading to my current position as CTO. This journey has not only been professionally enriching but has also given me the unique opportunity to live and contribute to the growth of a startup from its early stages to becoming a product used by thousands of people worldwide.

### **A journey of professional and business growth**

When I joined EducUp, the product had a limited user base but enormous potential. Over time, I had the opportunity to:

- **Learn to work in production consistently:** From handling the small day-to-day details to planning and executing critical implementations that ensured platform stability.
- **Implement improvements and new features:** One of the biggest challenges was balancing the continuous improvement of the existing product with the implementation of new functionalities that users demanded, without compromising quality.
- **Scale the platform:** Being part of the growth of a startup that went from being small to having a global impact meant learning to design systems and processes that supported scale, a challenge that rarely presents itself in a professional career. This type of experience, which mixes the dynamism of a startup with the need to think like an expanding company, is rare to find.

### **Technologies and challenges**

The growth of EducUp would not have been possible without a solid architecture and the use of modern technologies. From the beginning, I participated in the implementation of:

- **ASP.Net Core for the backend**, ensuring optimal performance and a robust foundation.
- **Firebase for analytics, authentication, and notifications**, enabling efficient monitoring and interaction with users.
- **Flutter for web and mobile applications**, achieving consistency across platforms.
- **Hangfire and CloudWatch** for background task management and monitoring, ensuring the platform operated efficiently.
- **SQL Server, Elastic Beanstalk, and Amplify**, among others, to ensure a reliable and scalable infrastructure.

### **The unique experience of working in a growing startup**

What makes this experience unique is having worked in a small company that, with effort and dedication, has achieved a global impact. This opportunity allowed me to learn along the way, experiment with technologies, solve complex problems in real-time, and see how the decisions we made as a team had a direct impact on users and the product's expansion.

Working at EducUp has taught me what it is like to build, improve, and scale a product from scratch, something that is rarely experienced in a professional career, as one usually ends up in small companies with limited resources or in large companies where growth is already consolidated. This experience has given me invaluable perspective and constant learning.
