## What is the project about?

The **Covid19 Cuba Data** project was an initiative aimed at collecting and presenting updated information on the evolution of COVID-19 in Cuba. Its main objective was to provide accurate data and interactive visualizations that would facilitate decision-making for both authorities and the general population. This effort combined science, technology, and journalism, integrating contributions from Postdata.club, the Juventud Técnica magazine, and the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of the University of Havana.

Some key features of the project included:

- An interactive website with detailed statistics and charts.
- A mobile application that allowed users to access data both online and offline.
- An open code and data approach that promoted transparency and collaboration.

More information about the project is available at [Juventud Técnica](https://www.cubaperiodistas.cu/2020/11/covid-19-cuba-data-ciencia-y-periodismo-para-tomar-decisiones/) and [CubaSí](https://cubasi.cu/es/noticia/covid19cubadata-una-herramienta-para-informarse-y-tomar-decisiones).

## Project achievements

Among the main achievements of Covid19 Cuba Data are:

- The creation of a digital platform that provided real-time access to pandemic data.
- The development of interactive tools that helped visualize the spread of the virus and assess the impact of health measures.
- The publication of the mobile application, which allowed users to consult data even without international internet access.
- Recognition as an example of collaboration between different sectors for the common good.

## My work on the project

As a developer of the project, I actively participated in various areas, with a particular focus on the mobile application. In this regard:

- I led the team responsible for developing the Android app, designing and implementing key features such as access to data from local mirrors and hybrid navigation.
- I implemented notification systems to alert users about new updates and important reminders.
- I contributed to designing a user experience that offered quick and reliable access to the most relevant data, even in environments with limited connectivity.

Additionally, I worked in collaboration with the web development team to ensure synchronization between the mobile application and the interactive platform of the site.

My contributions are reflected in several GitHub repositories, which can be consulted for more details:

Covid19 Cuba Data was more than a technical project; it was an experience that allowed me to work alongside a diverse and talented team to provide innovative solutions at a critical time.
